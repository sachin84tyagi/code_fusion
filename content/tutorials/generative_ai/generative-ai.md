# Generative AI — Simple, Clear & Professional Explanation

## 1. What is Generative AI (In One Line)

Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that can **create new content** such as text, images, audio, video, or code — similar to how a human creates — by learning patterns from existing data.

In simple words:

> Generative AI = Learn from data → Understand patterns → Create something new

It does NOT copy. It **generates** new output based on what it learned.

---

## 2. How Generative AI Works (Simple Flow)

1. It studies a huge amount of data (books, images, code, conversations, etc.)
2. It learns patterns, structure, and meaning
3. When you ask something, it predicts and generates the most relevant new output

Think like:
A chef learns thousands of recipes → You ask for a dish → Chef creates a new dish using learned knowledge.
